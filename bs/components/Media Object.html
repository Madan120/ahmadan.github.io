    <h1>Media object bootstap</h1>

    <!-- Example -->

    <div class="media">
        <img src="..." class="mr-3" alt="...">
        <div class="media-body">
          <h5 class="mt-0">Media heading</h5>
          <p>Will you do the same for me? It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse. Heard it's beautiful, be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote. I can feel a phoenix inside of me. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Yeah, you take me to utopia.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Alignment -->

      <div class="media">
        <img src="..." class="align-self-start mr-3" alt="...">
        <div class="media-body">
          <h5 class="mt-0">Top-aligned media</h5>
          <p>I’m gon’ put her in a coma. You give a hundred reasons why, and you say you're really gonna try. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. Suiting up for my crowning battle. And on my 18th Birthday we got matching tattoos. So très chic, yeah, she's a classic. I am ready for the road less traveled.</p>
          <p>I'm walking on air (tonight). But down to earth. You're original, cannot be replaced. But in another life I would be your girl. We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach. We can dance, until we die, you and I, will be young forever. Saw you downtown singing the Blues.</p>

        <!-- Media list -->

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li class="media">
              <img src="..." class="mr-3" alt="...">
              <div class="media-body">
                <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">List-based media object</h5>
                <p>All my girls vintage Chanel baby. So you can have your cake. Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air. Slowly swallowing down my fear, yeah yeah. Growing fast into a bolt of lightning. So hot and heavy, 'Til dawn. That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li class="media my-4">
              <img src="..." class="mr-3" alt="...">
              <div class="media-body">
                <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">List-based media object</h5>
                <p>Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed. Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine. Be your teenage dream tonight. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. It's not even a holiday, nothing to celebrate. A perfect storm, perfect storm.</p>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li class="media">
              <img src="..." class="mr-3" alt="...">
              <div class="media-body">
                <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">List-based media object</h5>
                <p>Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock? There’s no going back. This is the last time you say, after the last line you break. At the eh-end of it all.</p>
              </div>
